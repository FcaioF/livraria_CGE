Her investigation took her far beyond that question revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity With meticulous attention and stunning compassion Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes speaking with the lawyers who tried the case the family’s neighbors and relatives and teachers even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our age’s most important social issues from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty and a beautiful profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them It is disturbing insightful and mesmerizing in equal measure more\", \"abeafe151a587d3b\", \"books\", \"10.97\", \"10.97\", \"15\", \"1);\"]"
