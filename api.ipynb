potential foods nature offers humans have had to learn what is safe and what isntwhich mushrooms should be avoided for example and which berries we can enjoy Today as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder the omnivores dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us At the same time were realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment The Omnivores Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollans brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America Pollan has divided The Omnivores Dilemma into three parts one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food alternative or \"organic\" food and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting gathering or gardening Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on He concludes each section by sitting down to a mealat McDonalds at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods and in a revolutionary \"beyond organic\" farm in Virginia For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological

revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligentConsider as Ackerman does the Clark’s nutcracker a bird that can hide as many as 30000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the mockingbirds and thrashers species that can store 200 to 2000 different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon which knows where it’s going even thousands of miles from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow an impressive bird that makes its own tools But beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways Ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds They deceive and manipulate They eavesdrop They display a strong sense of fairness They give gifts They play keep-away and tug-of-war They tease They share They cultivate social networks They vie for status They kiss to console one another They teach their young They blackmail their parents They alert one another to

bird migration finding stardust for NASA and excavating mastodons The sheer number of citizen scientists combined with new technology has begun to shape how research is conducted Non-professionals become acknowledged experts: dentists turn into astronomers and accountants into botanistsDiary of a Citizen Scientist is a timely exploration of this phenomenon told through the lens of nature writer Sharman Apt Russell’s yearlong study of a little-known species the Western red-bellied tiger beetle In a voice both humorous and lyrical Russell recounts her persistent and joyful tracking of an insect she calls “charismatic” “elegant” and “fierce” Patrolling the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico collector’s net in hand she negotiates the realities of climate change even as she celebrates the beauty of a still-wild and rural landscapeRussell’s self-awarenessof her occasionally-misplaced confidence her quest to fill in “that blank spot on the map of tiger beetles” and her desire to become newly engaged in her lifecreates a portrait not only of the tiger beetle she tracks but of the mindset behind self-driven scientific inquiry Falling in love with the diversity of citizen science she participates in crowdsourcing programs that range from cataloguing galaxies to monitoring the phenology of native plants applauds the growing role of citizen science in environmental activism and marvels at the profusion of projects around the worldDiary of a Citizen Scientist offers its readers a glimpse into the transformative properties of citizen scienceand documents the

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And finally is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motionor does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself once the province of philosophy now occupy the territory where scientists philosophers and theologians meetif only to disagree In their new book Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously When applied to the universe as a whole this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it rather than that history creates us The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing each with different laws of natureAlong the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything” If confirmed they write it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for and the ultimate triumph of human reasonA succinct startling and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems The Grand Design is a book that will informand provokelike no other more', 'NR_UPC_NUMBER': '3213b1f13f5f0f7c', 'TP_PRODUCT_TYPE': 'books', 'NR_NO_TAX_PRICE': 13.76, 'NR_W_TAX_PRICE': 13.76, 'NR_TOTAL_AVAILABLE': '5', 'DS_BOOK_STAR': '3'}, {'ID_BOOK': 321, 'DT_PROCESS_DATE': '2023-08-27 18:29:57', 'DS_BOOK_CATEGORY': 'Science', 'DS_BOOK_TITLE': 'Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise', 'NR_BOOK_PRICE': '16.28', 'DS_BOOK_DESCRIPTION': 'A survey of the psychology of expertise providing techniques for developing mastery of any skill drawn from the authors extensive pathfinding research', 'NR_UPC_NUMBER': '6036239d2ab349b7', 'TP_PRODUCT_TYPE': 'books', 'NR_NO_TAX_PRICE': 16.28, 'NR_W_TAX_PRICE': 16.28, 'NR_TOTAL_AVAILABLE': '5', 'DS_BOOK_STAR': '2'}, {'ID_BOOK': 322, 'DT_PROCESS_DATE': '2023-08-27 18:29:58', 'DS_BOOK_CATEGORY': 'Science', 'DS_BOOK_TITLE': 'The Elegant Universe: Superstrings Hidden Dimensions and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory', 'NR_BOOK_PRICE': '13.03', 'DS_BOOK_DESCRIPTION': 'The international bestseller that inspired a major Nova special and sparked a new understanding of the universe now with a new preface and epilogueBrian Greene one of the worlds leading string theorists peels away layers of mystery to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself and all matterfrom the small The international bestseller that inspired a major Nova special and sparked a new understanding of the universe now with a new preface and epilogueBrian Greene one of the worlds leading string theorists peels away layers of mystery to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself and all matterfrom the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovasis generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy The Elegant Universe makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated accessible and thoroughly entertaining bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works more', 'NR_UPC_NUMBER': 'c6bf14cb901c63ac', 'TP_PRODUCT_TYPE': 'books', 'NR_NO_TAX_PRICE': 13.03, 'NR_W_TAX_PRICE': 13.03, 'NR_TOTAL_AVAILABLE': '3', 'DS_BOOK_STAR': '4'}, {'ID_BOOK': 323, 'DT_PROCESS_DATE': '2023-08-27 18:29:58', 'DS_BOOK_CATEGORY': 'Science', 'DS_BOOK_TITLE': 'The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements', 'NR_BOOK_PRICE': '57.35', 'DS_BOOK_DESCRIPTION': 'From New York Times bestselling author Sam Kean comes incredible stories of science history finance mythology the arts medicine and more as told by the Periodic Table Why did Gandhi hate iodine (I 53)?

Zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally and what this says about the line separating good from evilThe Lucifer Effect explains howand the myriad reasons whywe are all susceptible to the lure of “the dark side” Drawing on examples from history as well as his own trailblazing research Zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women Here for the first time and in detail Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment Within a week the study was abandoned as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual rather than the other way around

For starters theres a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story including a preface a list of \"Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book\" and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer flow chart of the books themes and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled \"Here is a drawing of a stapler:\") But on to the true story At the age of 22 Eggers became both an orphan and a \"single mother\" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers In the ensuing sibling division of labor Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother Christopher The two live together in semi-squalor decaying food and sports equipment scattered about while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities molesting babysitters and his own health His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brothers upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Herseys Hiroshima) The book is also perhaps less successfully about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic media-savvy Gen-X way naturally) In the early 90s Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine and he spends a fair amount of time here on Might the hipster culture of San Franciscos South Park and his own efforts to get on to MTVs Real World This sort of thing doesnt age very well--but then Eggers knows that Theres no criticism you can come up with that he hasnt put into AHWOSG already \"The book thereafter is kind of uneven\" he tells us regarding the contents after page 109 and while thats true its still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch Its a testament to Eggerss skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesnt Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeneys (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine) Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he cant feel an emotion without the sense that its already been felt for him What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him Oddly enough the effect is one of complete sincerity and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all

mythmaking Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine an age awash in apocalyptic fervor Scores of Jewish prophets preachers and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land bearing messages from God This was the age of zealotrya fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchyBalancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious “King of the Jews” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinityZealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth’s life and mission The result is a thought-provoking elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man a time and the birth of a religion more', 'NR_UPC_NUMBER':

bestselling author Andrew J Bacevich provides a searing reassessment of US military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades From the end of World War II until 1980 virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East Since 1990 virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere else What caused this shift? Andrew J Bacevich one of the country’s most respected voices on foreign affairs offers an incisive critical history of this ongoing military enterprisenow more than thirty years old and with no end in sight During the 1980s Bacevich argues a great transition occurred As the Cold War wound down the United States initiated a new conflicta War for the Greater Middle Eastthat continues to the present day The long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting But as this new war unfolded hostilities became persistent From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Central Asia US forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the Islamic world Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success Instead actions undertaken with expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite As a consequence phrases like “permanent war” and “open-ended war” have become part of everyday discourse Connecting the dots in a way no other historian has done before Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied as the Beirut bombing of 1983 the Mogadishu firefight of 1993 the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the rise of ISIS in the present decade Understanding what America’s costly military exertions have wrought requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war It also requires identifying the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who share responsibility for what has become a monumental march

BESTSELLEROne of America’s most accomplished entrepreneursa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technologySteve Case’s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985 At the time only three percent of Americans were online It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service After Case engineered AOL’s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world In The Third Wave which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title and whose work inspired him as a young man) Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur an investor a philanthropist and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies We are entering as Case explains a new paradigm called the “Third Wave” of the Internet The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution Now Case argues we’re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major “real world” sectors like health education transportation energy and foodand in the process change the way we live our daily lives But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set and Case outlines the path forwardThe Third Wave is part memoir part manifesto and part playbook for the future With passion and clarity Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which he argues will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers with competitors and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategiesand how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age more', 'NR_UPC_NUMBER': '3bebf34ee9330cbd', 'TP_PRODUCT_TYPE': 'books',

diplomat writer and business strategist and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity and he invented a rod to tame it He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances local lending libraries and national legislatures He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nations federal compromise He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union the Declaration of Independence the treaty of alliance with France the peace treaty with England and the Constitution And he helped invent Americas unique style of homespun humor democratic values and philosophical pragmatism But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented and continually reinvented was himself Americas first great publicist he was in his life and in his writings consciously trying to create a new American archetype In the process he carefully crafted his own persona portrayed it in public and polished it for posterity Through it all he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow \"leather-aprons\" more than he did those of any inbred elite He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength not as something to be derided His guiding principle was a \"dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people\" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully and none so intuitively In this colorful and intimate narrative Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklins amazing life from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman scientist

What if the real threat to the American Dream isn’t rising income inequalitybut an all-out war on success?In Equal is Unfair a timely and thought-provoking work Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost everything we’ve been taught about inequality is wrong You’ll discover:• why successful CEOs make so much moneyand deserve to• how the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to help• why

right about one thing: the American Dream is under attack But instead of fighting to make America a place where anyone can achieve success they are fighting to tear down those who already have The

personal investigation of the causes effects and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimethe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville TexasOn March 11 2003 in Brownsville Texasone of America’s poorest citiesJohn Allen Rubio and Angela Camacho murdered their three young children The apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed It was a place neighbors felt that was plagued by spiritual cancer In 2008 journalist Laura Tillman covered the story for The Brownsville Herald The questions it raised haunted her particularly one asked by the sole member of the city’s Heritage Council to oppose demolition: is there any such thing as an evil building? Her investigation took her far beyond that question revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity With meticulous attention and stunning compassion Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes speaking with the lawyers who tried the case the family’s neighbors and relatives and teachers even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our age’s most important social issues from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty and a beautiful profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them It is disturbing insightful and mesmerizing in equal measure more', 'NR_UPC_NUMBER': 'abeafe151a587d3b', 'TP_PRODUCT_TYPE': 'books', 'NR_NO_TAX_PRICE': 10.97, 'NR_W_TAX_PRICE': 10.97, 'NR_TOTAL_AVAILABLE': '15', 'DS_BOOK_STAR': '1'}]\n"
